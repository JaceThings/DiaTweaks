    You sort a person's browser tabs by subject. Each tab is its title, then its web address. For each tab, in order:
    - about: 2 to 6 English words on what the page is for, naming the actual product, brand, place or topic from the \
    title or the address. Titles can be in any language.
    - subject: 1 or 2 lowercase English words naming the thing the tab is about. If an earlier tab is about the same \
    thing, copy its subject exactly. Otherwise write a new one.

    Rules:
    - The subject is the thing, not the activity: shopping for, reading about and comparing headphones are all \
    "headphones".
    - Different shops or apps for the same kind of thing share a subject: two perfume shops are "perfume", two \
    whiteboard apps are "whiteboard apps", a MacBook and an iPhone are "apple products".
    - Everything for one trip shares a subject: flights, hotels and guides for Lisbon are all "lisbon trip".
    - Different animals, foods or places are different subjects: cats and dogs are not the same.

    Example tabs:
    tab1: Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 41 – Men's Road Running Shoes (nike.com/t/air-zoom-pegasus-41)
    tab2: Wie lange kochen Eier? (chefkoch.de/magazin/eier-kochen)
    tab3: Flights Berlin to Lisbon – Skyscanner (skyscanner.net/routes/ber/lis)
    tab4: Wyprzedaż do -50% (sklepbiegacza.pl/buty-do-biegania)
    tab5: Best wet food for kittens (catster.com/guides/kitten-food)
    tab6: Hotels in Alfama, Lisbon – Booking.com (booking.com/district/pt/lisbon/alfama)
    tab7: dog training tips - Google Search (google.com/search)
    tab8: Royal Canin vs Purina kitten food (reddit.com/r/cats)
    tab9: Inbox (12) - Outlook (outlook.live.com/mail)

    Example answers:
    tab1 about: shopping for Nike running shoes; subject: running shoes
    tab2 about: how long to boil eggs; subject: eggs
    tab3 about: flights from Berlin to Lisbon; subject: lisbon trip
    tab4 about: running shoe sale; subject: running shoes
    tab5 about: choosing kitten food; subject: cat food
    tab6 about: hotels in Lisbon; subject: lisbon trip
    tab7 about: dog training tips; subject: dog training
    tab8 about: comparing kitten food brands; subject: cat food
    tab9 about: reading email; subject: email

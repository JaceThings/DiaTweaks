# Contributing

Keep it small, test it hard, show it working.

## Pull requests

- One change per PR.
- Fill in the template: What, Why, Proof, Tested on, Checklist. Short sentences.
- Never leave a section empty or delete it. If one doesn't apply, write `N/A` in it, and tick a checklist item that doesn't apply with `(N/A)` after it. Proof is never N/A for a change you can see in Dia.
- Proof is required for anything visible in Dia: a screenshot for static changes, a screen recording for anything that animates. Show before and after when you change existing behaviour.
- Try to break what you made before you open the PR, and fix what you find. Every change has to work with tabs in the sidebar and tabs at the top, and with each tweak on and off.
- Build with `make` and run it on your own Dia with `./install.sh`. Then run `make test`.

## Adding a patch

Each patch is one folder in `src/dylib/Patches/`, built on StdPatch: `src/dylib/StdPatch/StdPatch.h` is the whole API. Apart from its [page](#documenting-a-patch), nothing outside the folder changes.

- `make patch NAME=HideFooButton` creates `Patches/HideFooButton/HideFooButton.m` with a `DP_PATCH` in it. That registers it: its row in Settings, its saved switch, its place in `make test` and its entry in `build/patches.json`, the list `diatweaks` shows, come from the fields, and `.order` sets where it's listed.
- Find what to change with the developer tools. Turn them on with `defaults write com.diapatches devTools -bool YES`, relaunch Dia, and use **Help → DiaPatches: Copy View Tree** for the front window's views with their classes, frames and accessibility labels.
- Hiding a button only takes a `.hides` function, such as `DPHasLabel(view, @"Recent tabs")` or `DPIsKind(view, DPDiaLibraryButton)`. StdPatch hides it wherever Dia shows it, and checks it in `make test`.
- Anything else hooks Dia in `.install` with `DPHook`, and calls through with `DPCallOriginal`. Dia's class names go in `StdPatch/Dia.h`.
- `.apply` applies a toggle at once. Without it the patch animates: `progress` eases between 0 and 1 while `.relayout` runs each frame.
- `.section` is its group in Settings. `.requires` and `.disabledBy` take another patch's key; a patch that requires another is listed as an option on that one's page instead of in a section.
- List the Dia classes it relies on in `.classes`. On a Dia version without one of them, the patch stays off and Settings shows it as unavailable.
- Give it a `.verify` that looks at Dia's views and returns `nil` when they match `on`, or a few words saying what's wrong. Find the views with `DPFindViews`, not through your own hooks, so a hook that never ran shows up as a failure.
- Keep files to about 100 lines. Split a big patch into several files in its folder.

With the developer tools on, a script can also drive Dia: post the distributed notification `com.diapatches.dev.set` with the object `hideToolbar=1` to flip a switch, or `com.diapatches.dev.dump` to write every window's view tree to `~/Library/Application Support/DiaPatches/views.txt`.

## Documenting a patch

Every tweak has a page on the [wiki](https://github.com/JaceThings/DiaTweaks/wiki), titled as it is in Settings. For a new patch, fill in [`docs/tweak-page.md`](docs/tweak-page.md) in your PR description with before and after screenshots: PNG, at most 1400 pixels wide, cropped to the part of Dia the tweak changes, with none of your own tabs in them. A maintainer puts it on the wiki and links it from the sidebar before merging.

Its page in Settings shows a preview from the wiki repo's `previews` folder, 16:10: `vertical-<key>.mp4` recorded with tabs in the sidebar, `horizontal-<key>.mp4` with tabs at the top, or a `.png` of either. Settings shows the one matching Dia's layout and falls back to the other, so one is enough unless the tweak looks different in each. Encode videos at 1120×700 and 60 fps: `ffmpeg -i in.mp4 -an -vf fps=60,scale=1120:700 -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -crf 26 -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart vertical-<key>.mp4`.

CI fails if a patch has no wiki page or the sidebar doesn't link to it. Run `scripts/check-tweak-docs` after `make` to check.

## Testing

`make test` installs your build's dylib and reopens Dia in test mode. Dia tries the patches all off, all on, each on its own and in pairwise combinations without saving any of it, runs every patch's `verify` after each, then goes back to your settings. The script prints what failed and exits non-zero if anything did. It can't move the tabs between the sidebar and the top, so run it once in each layout. Square corners only get tested with the sidebar open.

To try `install.sh`, `diapatch` or `diatweaks` without touching your own Dia, point `DIAPATCH_APP` at a copy of Dia, `DIAPATCH_HOME`, `DIAPATCH_CACHE` and `DIATWEAKS_LINK_DIR` at scratch folders and `DIATWEAKS_DOMAIN` at a settings domain of its own, and set `DIAPATCH_NO_RELAUNCH=1` so nothing quits or opens Dia. `DIAPATCH_RELEASES` points `diapatch self-update` at a release JSON of your own, which can use `file://` links.

## Releasing

1. Tag main and push the tag: `git tag v1.2.0 && git push origin v1.2.0`. Versions are `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. To open the notes with an announcement, tag with a message instead: `git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "…"`.
2. The Release workflow builds `DiaTweaks.zip` and opens a draft release with it attached. Its notes are drafted in this order, leaving out empty sections:
   - 📣 Announcement: the tag's message.
   - ✨ New tweaks: every patch added since the last tag, with its description and wiki page.
   - ⚡️ Improvements: every other `feat`.
   - 🐛 Fixes: every `fix` and `perf`.
   - 🧪 Tested with Dia `VERSION`: replace it with the Dia you tested on.
3. Reword the notes as you like, then publish. Settings doesn't show them, only a Release Notes link to the release. Installs see it the next time Dia opens or someone checks.

Installs compare the zip's digest, not the version. To fix a release without a new version, push the fix to main, move the tag (`git tag -f v1.2.0 && git push -f origin v1.2.0`), then run the Release workflow by hand with that tag. It replaces the zip, and everyone gets it as an update, including people who already installed the broken one. Edit the notes on GitHub at any time. Keep immutable releases off in the repo settings, or GitHub won't let the zip change.

## AI tools

Use whatever tools you like. You're responsible for what you submit: it has to work, and you have to have tested it yourself.

No slop: no padded descriptions, generated summaries or filler ("comprehensive", "robust", "seamless", "this PR introduces…"). PRs that read like unchecked AI output are closed without review.
